# RSL-Docs
The documentation for the Re-mars-tered Script Loader, a lua scripting API and modding tool for Red Faction Guerrilla Re-mars-tered. Available [here](https://rsl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The docs are written in restructuredText files (.rst) which is then generated into a documentation page by sphinx. The docs are hosted and automatically rebuilt by [Read the docs](https://readthedocs.org/). See the [contribution guide](https://rsl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Contributing.html) for info on how to change the docs.
